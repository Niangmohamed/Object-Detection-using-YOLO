# Object Detection using YOLO

<p align='justify'>By applying object detection, you’ll not only be able to determine what is in an image, but also where a given object resides. We’ll start with a brief discussion of the YOLO object detector, including how the object detector works.</p>

## What is the YOLO object detector?

<p align='justify'>When it comes to deep learning-based object detection, there are three primary object detectors you’ll encounter:</p>

* R-CNN and their variants, including the original R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, and Faster R-CNN;

* Single Shot Detector (SSDs);

* YOLO.

<p align='justify'>R-CNNs are one of the first deep learning-based object detectors and are an example of a two-stage detector.</p>
